    <h5> What is a Prospectives Account? </h5>
    <p>
        A Prospectives Account allows you to keep track of the point system. What you can do with your account:
         <ul>
            <li> Sign up for sophomore meals. </li>
            <li> Sign up for our club wide events. </li>
         </ul>

       When you become a member, your account will be upgraded to a full member account. Your account will also allow you to view parts of the websitess that are for prospectives only!
    </p>

    <h5> Who should make one? </h5>
    <p> The prospectives account should only be made for sophomores. Freshmen cannot join eating clubs until their sophomore year. Upperclassmen can join directly (email one of our officers). </p>

    <h5> How do I make one? </h5>
    <p> <a href="{% url 'login' %}"> Login </a> with your Princeton netid first, and we'll use Princeton CAS system to create an account for you our database. </p>
